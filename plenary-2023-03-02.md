#### 3. Welcoming and introduction to new members: 
Welcome to Lewis Conn (Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO)) and Stephen Bowman. 

#### 4. Follow-up on previous meeting's Action Items
#### 5. ToR & MoU status review
* Slow progress with Finance Legal Services, worthwhile considering other organisations who might have capacity - but who also have a role or a dependency and who are departments of state. For example: DCCEEW? DAFF? ABS? GeoScience?
* Action: John M. to inquire with Network/Domain area at Finance about interest in 'co-sponsoring' request to Legal Services.
* Action: Kheeran (DCCEEW), Stephen (DAFF) to explore with their organisations.
* Action: Nicholas to send out current documents.

#### 6. ARDC PID System update
* ARDC has requested control of the current PID system, by June ideally. This will mean all technical services will be provided by ARDC from the date of transfer.
* image.linked.data.gov.au as a parallel system for image management in Australia - use case originating from HASS Commons (Jenny F. coordinates) based on IIIF (https://iiif.io/) image preservation standard.  "Image" was chosen over "GLAM" due to the complexity of the GLAM domain. Applications for other domains that involve images also likely exist.  Q. John M.: is there any involvement from the NAA in this? A. Sandra S.: not yet, but would be pleased if they were interested.
