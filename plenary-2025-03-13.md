### 6. Action Items

### 8. General business

Peter Carter encouraged members of this group to engage with supply chain and international (UN) transparency work that uses Linked Data approaches and which Australians are involved with. He also pointed out that Stnandards Australia have co-adopted ISO18975:2024 Information technology — Automatic identification and data capture techniques — Encoding and resolving identifiers over HTTP](https://www.iso.org/standard/85540.html) HTTP URIs for identifiers and that this should give Linked Data acceptance by government a boost.
