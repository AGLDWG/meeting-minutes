* **MoU** - Richard

* **Licenses Dataset** - Nick: 
    * I am working with Madrid Polytechnic & The ODI to create a trustable Semantic Web licenses dataset. If this works out (by ~June) I will look to add recommendations for the use of its licenses within AGOP and other AGLDWG-relevant protocols. See the demonstrator system: <http://rdflicense.appspot.com/>.
* **Australian Government Ontology Profile** - Nick
   * Nick described the AGOP, noted there was no hard requirement for a WG approvale/release of it
   * he will request an IRI for it in the normal way and then make a "0.5" release
   * Anu suggested checking the Profile's requirements v. OBO Foundary's for ontology best practice
* **Governance** - Laurent
   * Laurent raised governance of PID allocations - more could be done to ensure more review of PIDs before allocation
   * Nick mentioned that it is hoped the new ARDC system will greatly assist governance with defined workflows and automated notification sending
