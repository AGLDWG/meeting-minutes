Presentations

1. Michael Pronin ‚Äî Service Design and Engagement ‚Äî> GovCMS slides and demo ‚Äî> RaC Rules as Code: takes legislation, regulations and policy and turning them into machine-readable code.  OpenFisca is an open source Python implementation rules engine. MOP(S) ‚Äî> Ministerial and Parliamentary Services. Production instance 4-6 months away; options for classification of privacy. 
    1. Question form Michael Hodgkin ‚Äî> can expose answers as JSON from API ‚Äî> enables rules for Linked Data not just results ‚Äî> more dynamic. Regenerates ontological records from underlying rules when you query the API. 
    2. Comment from Michael Hodgkin ‚Äî> AI-adjacent is important. Very excited about this 
    3. Comment from Rob Atkinson ‚Äî> data provenance modelling and where the interoperability of provenance modelling can be worked on? MP reply modelling simulations. Fisca does microsimulations 

2. Ann Goldsack and Michael Elliott-Smith  - Department of Recources in Queensland ‚Äî> spatial data in a non-spatial database ‚Äî>  Semantic Web model for address information ‚Äî> now adopted as the national model for addressing! https://linked.data.gov.au/def/addr. Vocabularies ‚Äî> geographic place types and features ‚Äî> conversion into a controlled vocabulary required a rethinking of the traditional way of structuring. Much expansion of the vocabulary in this process as well. Defining concepts and working out how to cluster concepts (e.g. parent-child). On-going maintenance is also a challenge. More exploration to do before full-on implementation of the tools in full force. Feeling proud! Have come along way - it‚Äôs not unachievable to anyone! Much appreciation and gratitude to Nic and the Kurrawong team :) 
    1. Rob Atkinson questions: Is there a polyhiearchical coding in existence? Edmond ‚Äî> JSON-LD ‚Äî> SHACL SHAPEs can be publicly published 

Al Paton Gov-Hack

Hi Brains trust

Matthias did you send it to Finance?
[16:02] John Machin (Unverified)
If so, please try john.machin@homeaffairs.gov.au!
[16:02] Matthias Liffers (ARDC; he/him) (Unverified)
I did. Have you got a new job I didn't hear about?
[16:03] Matthias Liffers (ARDC; he/him) (Unverified)
tl;dr if someone could send me the official meeting invite that would be great.

I can showcase the modular JSON-LD implementation of the ICSM 3D Cadastre Survey Data Exchange Model.

"Ministerial and Parliamentary Services"
[16:25] Rob Atkinson (Unverified)
JSON-LD implying an underlying ontology?
Matthias Liffers (ARDC; he/him) (Unverified)16:32
No question, but this is rather exciting. I'm thinking how this could be useful for researchers in determining their obligations within all the rules they work under.

Rob A. says: "What does the (LD) provenance space look like once AI is involved?"
[16:34] Hodgkin, Michael (Unverified)
provenance is just another set of rules, isn't it? ¬†
[16:35] Rob Atkinson (Unverified)
interoperability of provenance solutions in many overlapping application domains...
John Machin (Unverified)16:35 Yes, but I would say it is an interesting one. Maybe we need to have another big community chat about it again? 
[16:42] John Machin (Unverified)
A great achievement.¬†
Australian jurisdictions have historically taken a very long time to reach consistency of approach.

A common experience for many (especially those who have spent a lot of time with statistical classifications?) I expect.

I'm outting my past self here!
[16:52] Hodgkin, Michael (Unverified)
Were there any metaphors, stories or concepts you found useful to convey taxonomies and polyhierarchy to your stakeholders? ¬†
[16:53] Rob Atkinson (Unverified)
When doing the ICSM Cadastre model we needed a JSON-LD encoding - we ended up with a placeholder pending an authoritative solution: https://icsm-au.github.io/3d-csdm-profile-icsm/bblock/icsm.profiles.datatypes.address

[16:55] Edmond (Unverified)
There is an unofficial JSON-LD context + framing used within the UI admin system for the addresses system. We may be able to publish this in the future alongside the Address data model.

Hodgkin, Michael (Unverified)17:00
On feature naming, the google leak showed how they handle it¬†
¬†
Their schema has support for a distinct feature name per room, per structure, per person. Presumably so we can all have our own pet name to describe our bathrooms.
¬†
Seemed like overkill for our use cases, but amazing they thought of that. ¬†

(Unverified)John Machin (Unverified)17:00
Thanks for coming everyone!
We are close to time, but I can keep the meeting going a while longer if the discussion is still going.¬†
If you have to go thanks for the time you could share.

[17:03] Rob Atkinson (Unverified)
sounds like two summits - provenance and address schemas for JSON-LD use.

[17:03] Tran, Tran (Unverified)
Thanks all! Great work!

[17:04] Margie Smith (Unverified)
Thank you Anne and Michael.

[17:06] Michael Elliott-Smith (Unverified)
Anne & I are going to disappear. Thank you for the opportunity to present today!
