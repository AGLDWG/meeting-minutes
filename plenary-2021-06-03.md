### 2. Welcoming and introduction to new members
Welcome to
* Jennifer Mitchell (Bureau of Meteorology)

### 3. Finance KG and structure.gov.au
John Machin reported on https://structure.gov.au a website backed by the Finance Knowledge Graph that shows some of the information about the structure of the Australian Government held by the Department of Finance. The site is to assist in the understanding of some of the structures, but is also to encourage inquiry from potential users of data services based on the KG. Please feel encouraged to check it out and provide feedback.

### 5. Engagement with ONDS

* John M. notes that a conversation with Thomas Hogan (ONDC) and John Newman (ABS) was had about the prior work and governance arrangements of the AGLDWG but that no followup on this has occurred at this time from ONDC.
