AGLDWG (not really a) Plenary 3pm 5th July 2023
-----------------------------------------------

Note: The following rough informal notes, for the record, of this short gathering were taken by Sandra Silcot, as Nick Car was unable to attend.

About 10-12 people showed up but dropped off when it was clear Nick couldn't make it. 

Whilst waiting, minutes of the June plenary were reviewed and the consensus was they were ok, although there was no formal motion to that effect.

Lesley Wyborn wanted to bring this upcoming conference in Canberra to the groups attention; it should be of interest to a wide variety of environmental researchers and data scientists in the environmental space, including those with an Indigenous focus. Early career researchers are particularly welcome. 

Registration has been extended for one week: https://www.tern.org.au/integrated-earth/

Everyone departed by about 20 minutes past 3pm.
