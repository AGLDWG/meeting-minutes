## 5. ARDC progress & IRI Registry
Nicholas and Armin comment on the need for specificity of namespaces - identifying some extremely large and quite conceptual namespaces that may need to be reoriented. Discussion parked since several important stakeholders in the discussion not present.

Nicholas identifies the IRI registry ontology for controlling information in the IRI registry.This assists with automation of some of the processes involved with registration and will work with Drupal, including GovCMS.

## 6. Website refresh
Armin notes to the meeting that this is to be delayed until the ARDC work is complete. Armin also observes that the chairs have agreed to more prominently "eat our own dogfood" and include some more demonstrations, including how were are using linked data approaches to manage AGLDWG activities.

ACTION: All members please give thought to suggestions for changes, additions, and etc. for the website.

Sandra: what services might ARDC be planning to offer in this area?
Nicholas: there is a plan but for extending services, but it is not firm at this time. If this next stage of progressive release of services is successful then further services may be offered.

## 7. Other business
### OPSI catalogue
John notes that OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is looking for new groups to nominate for inclusion and suggests that AGLDWG does so. No objections are heard. Armin recommends contacting Bernadette Hyland-Woods (not present at meeting) but to proceed with nomination after this.

ACTION: John to contact Bernadette, and the proceed with nomination.

### SURROUND's KG API
Nicholas discusses SURROUND's recent work on an API to manage and maintain multiple KGs and plans on providing a specification for the API that goes beyond the regular graph store protocol API, as implemented by systems such as RDF4J. 

### Reference Dataset publishing
Nicholas described the Geologicla Survey of Qld's intention to publish a "Reference Dataset", that is a complex dataset, not a vocabulary, that is used as a reference by other data. The dataset is the Geological Features of Qld, which has already been converted into RDF (https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/qldgeofeatures-dataset) so the purpose of this project is to publish it live, online, via an API with full QGS ownership. Likely to start in July, project will run for 3 months and government members of the AGLDWG are encouraged to observe. 

### J2RM Mapping software
Armin discusses JSON to RDF Model Mapping software, an output of the AGRIF project. Maps from JSON objects to RDF and is able to be built directly into the ontology allowing more efficient building of graphs from JSON.
