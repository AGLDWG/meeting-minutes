#### 4. Follow-up on previous meeting's Action Items

#### 5. July Speaker: Cameron Brenton

Questions/Comments:

Nicholas Car: Access control can be difficult. What about decision fatigue when people just give access to everything. Government agencies can use pods for transitioning data. Cameron: One interface that is a digital assistant that manages your decision fatigue and learns what is accessible for whom.
Armin Haller: What is the business model for Pod infrastructure. Cameron: Pod operators charge fees for access to Pods. Or advertisments that are more targeted, i.e., they read out your preferences and present an ad before consumption of a service.
Steven De Costa: 5 years ago I was introduced. Database holder that has all emails and can broadcast message that are authorised, i.e., can reduce spam. Is this still a use case? Cameron: Pod Service brokers are still under consideration in Europe.
Irina Bastrakova: Governance overhead for people that manage pods. Citizens don't trust Governments. How can Governments convince citizens to share data with them. Cameron: Different cultures, i.e., what they have done in the Flemish Government won't be possible here. New special interest identities should own these pods.
