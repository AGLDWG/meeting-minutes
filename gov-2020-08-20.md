# Visibility and Governance sub-WG meeting, 2020-08-20
A short VIZ/GOV sub-group meeting was held today.

## Attendees:
Brigette, John Machin, Tessa Ellieff

## Updates:
### Governance:
Update from John Machin: Ontologies of activities – AGRIF working with ANU on this, talking about what to do after that. Possibly with a focus for how we do more of this for Dept of Finances. But also how can we turn this to doing things better.
Potential governance models: High levels group that acts as a group with oversight, and then people who actually do the work. Such as a community of practice. Therefore, a Community of Attention (high level) and a Community of Practice (practitioners). The CoA would be people who see a place for change, act as an audience, ask questions of the community of practice. Identify priorities because of their connections in gov. Encourage the CoP to move towards certain sorts of work.

### Visibility:
People in the sub-group have been tasked with approaching agencies to be sure that we have representation at the AGM. Brigette has started on her list. Other VIZ folks, don’t forget to do that outreach!
